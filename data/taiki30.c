/* Omega Red (character 30): the computer's waiting lists.
   What it does while nothing calls for more. PLAYER_WORK's cpu_adrs[0] points here, and em_cmd_sel
   picks a list from it.

   taiki30_tbl     one record (CPU_DATA): the offsets of the three tables.
   taiki30_rate    the chance, out of 32, that a list's CMD_NEXT goes over to an attack list
                   (atck30.c), by the level of play.
   taiki30_sel     for each of the computer's levels (cpu_lv), 32 picks; one is taken at random.
   taiki30_cmd     the lists: a pick is a number in this table.
   taiki30_cmd_NN  a list, in the commands of cpu_cmd.h. CMD_JUMP and the other jumps name a
                   list of lib30.c. */
